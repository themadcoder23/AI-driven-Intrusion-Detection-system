# AI-Based Restricted Zone Intrusion Detection System

An AI-powered computer vision system that automatically detects unauthorized human presence inside restricted zones using video feeds. The system captures visual evidence, logs intrusion events to the cloud, and sends real-time alerts—eliminating the need for continuous manual CCTV monitoring.

---

## Key Features
- AI-based human detection using YOLO  
- Restricted Zone (ROI) based intrusion detection  
- False-alarm reduction using persistence logic  
- Snapshot capture as visual evidence  
- Cloud logging of intrusion events using **Google Firebase Firestore**  
- Real-time email alert notifications  
- Works with existing CCTV or surveillance-style video feeds  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8**
- **Google Firebase Firestore**
- SMTP (Email alerts)

---

## How It Works
1. Video feed is processed frame-by-frame  
2. AI model detects human presence  
3. Restricted zone (ROI) validation is applied  
4. Intrusion is confirmed after sustained presence  
5. Snapshot is captured as evidence  
6. Event metadata is logged to Firebase  
7. Email alert is sent to authorized personnel

## Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/intrusion-detection-system.git
cd intrusion-detection-system
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python firebase-admin
```

*(Python 3.9+ recommended)*

---

### 3️⃣ Firebase Setup (Required)
1. Create a Firebase project
2. Enable **Firestore Database**
3. Download the Firebase service account key  
4. Rename it to:
```
firebase_key.json
```
5. Place it in the project root


---

### 4️⃣ Configure Email Alerts
Edit `alert_email.py` and configure:
- Sender email
- App password (SMTP)
- Receiver email

*(Gmail App Password recommended)*

---

### 5️⃣ Run the System
```bash
python main.py
```

- Select the restricted zone (ROI) on the first frame  
- Press **ENTER** to confirm  
- System starts monitoring automatically
